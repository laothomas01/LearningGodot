player upgrades:
	attacks:
		- close combat
		- ranged
		- area 

understanding signals:

Enemy:
- hurtbox // receive damage or healing upon collision with another hurtbox 
	// Examples
	
	1) player attacks enemy
		- attack_hitbox -> enemy_hurtbox 
			- enemy receives damage 
	2) player walks into enemy
		- enemy_hitbox -> player_hurtbox 
			- player receives damage 
	4) enemy attacks player
		- enemy_attack_hitbox -> player_hurtbox 
			- player receives damage 
		
- hitbox // send damage or healing upon collision with another hurtbox 



Features:
[X] player walk into enemy, player takes damage 
	player_hurt_box -> enemy_hit_box 
		- player takes damage 
		[x] player hurtbox temporarily disappears after taking damage
				- iframes 
[X] enemy moves toward player 
[x] shoot projectiles
[x] remove enemy upon death // health goes to 0
[] combat attack
	[] 
[] flip character based on horizontal face direction 
[] set up a simple upgrade gui 


What makes a game fun?
fun:
- incentives 
	- game instills player curiosity
	- game instils player to challenge themselves 
	- game rewards player for their efforts 	
		- different approaches to gameplay 

=============
Features to get done:

Testing:
[] test enemy detection
[] test player level up 



============ 06 - 1 - 2024 =============

what I have/have not accomplished already:

Player Scene:
x simple upgrade database 
x create handler for changes to player transform2D
	- player can flip horizontally 
x enemy detection
x undetect enemy  
x user input 
x basic movement
x experience gain 
  	 x test function
  	  x detect gems within collection area 
  	  	x when detected:
  	  			// a future feature 
  	  		  have gem move towards player
  	  		  	if hits player:
  	  				x delete gem
x take damage 
x ability cooldown 
x level up ability

enemy spawning
x player takes damage
	x upon collision, disable hurtbox, re-enable after X number of seconds 
	
- enemy takes damage 
- enemy is removed from game when dies 



backlog:
  update ability behavior/attributes based on current ability level 
  detected item moved towards player 
  customize your germ 

====
06 - 2 - 2024 

[] have gem move to player when within item collection range (or not)
[] add more abilities to test level up and acquire different attacks 
[] imlement the enemy spawner
	[x] basic spawner implemented
	 [] implement enemy waves?
[x] implement varying behaviors of abilities based on their level 
[] do we want items ? 
[] implement passive abilities 
	- going to have to refactor some code 
	[] add debuff abilities? 
 
[] destructible environments
[] 



======
how can i make a slightly better product than vampire survivors????
	better controls?
	better progression? 
	mini bosses?
	better items?
	better aesthetics??
	what does it mean to be an invading germ inside a human body?
	what does it mean to even make a game fun? 
	how do you make grinding fun?
	- iterative progression??
	capture points???
	
	
	3 pillars:
	incentives
	curiosity
	rewards
	
	why is vampire survivors addicting?
	
	how can evolution be addicting?
	
	each level is a next stage in evolution???
	
	environmental interactions???
	
	why slot machines???
	
	how can we make "slot machine" gameplay fun???
	
	- game gives you random abilities 
	- can gamble for stronger abilities if you have currency 
	
	
	game is about working with what you are given and then taking a chance to possibly rise in life or just fall 
	
	
	
	
designs we need to figure out:

[]   enemy design 

[ ] progreession system 


[ ] level design 

[ ] 
	abilities must be sorted in tiers:
	
			
	
	
	tier 1: 70%  chance to obtain 
		- melee attack
		- ranged attack
		- area attack 
		- 
	tier 2: 25% chance to obtain
	
	tier 3: 5% chance to obtain 
	
	
what kind of game do we want?
- vampire survivors game where obtaining items and abiliities if completely random:
	- spend collected currency(not actual cash) to have a chance at obtain a stronger ability
	

what am i trying to do now?? 
- lets code a bunch of abilities the player can use??? 


Randomized Vampire Survivors Clone:

what does it mean?
- in-game abilities will be seperated by tiers:
	tier 1
		- basic automated easy to use abilities
		
		 
	tier 2
		- stronger 
	tier 3
		- 
=================================================


Vampire Survivors Clone:

game features:

data base of abilities:

ranged_combat
close_combat
area_combat 

how do i want to design my game?
- very basic template game 

[] level up player
[] player can gain exp 
[] select ability from upgrade menu 
[] player can level up ability



ability upgrade feature:
player levels -> open upgrade menu -> show upgrade selection
player selects an upgrade:
	- upgrade ability level 
	- 


===================

Vampire Survivors Clone:
[x] basic player movement 
[x] player takes damage when colliding into enemy 
[x] player colides into gem and gains exp
[x] player levels up 
[] knock back 
[] check if projectile area2D is only hitting ONE area2D unless is explosive or is melee attack 
[] make attacking slime 
[] make slime that upon death, creates a death puddle for a temporary amount of seconds 
[] make slime that can shoot projectiles
[] make big boss slime that makes other slimes
	[] add some attack behaviors (without using an attack animation ) 
	 
========================= DESIGN DOCUMENT =================================

Necessities needed for an MVP:

(need to consider player experience and how they want your game to feel for the foreseeable future) 

[] game pacing
	- we can never speed up the early game process but we can make sure it never feels sluggish to restart 
		- player can start with a special item and a default weapon (similar to slay the spire. might just copy the starting options of slay the spire )
		- (later down the line) player can pick a room to survive through 
		- player levels up, selects skills, and persists those upgrades throughout the game stages
			- this allows player to focus solely on the player's survivability  
		note: types of game pacings:
			- timed levels/floors <--- i think i like this more than "survive for 1000000 hours" (adds progression) 
				- each floor gets more harder 
				- enemy variety differs as the levels progress
 
[] gameplay accesibility
	- player should be able to experiment with different gameplay approaches to achieve the game's goal
	- given the tools from the developer, the player has to figure out which game play approach is optimal	
	- game is challenging enough to incentivize players to come back and revise their gameplay

Want to build an MVP:


marketing appraoches:
[] who is my audience?? 


core concept of game:
- horde survival vampire survivor clone or roguelike 
- play as different demon clases:
	 werewolf(druid) <- focus on this for now 
	 	- toolkit:
	 		melee 
	 		- 80% melee skills 
	 		- 10% ranged skills 
	 		- 10% defense skills 
	 vampire(paladin)
	 	- toolkit:
	 		melee and ranged
	 		- 40% melee skills
	 		- 40% ranged skills
	 		- 20% defense skills 
	 cthulu (necromancer)
	 	- toolkit:
	 		ranged
	 	
	 litch (sorcerer)
	 succubus (assassin)
	 some forest god (amazon)  
	 
- survive the forces of god
- how can i differentiate this from vampire survivors???
	- how about timed floors that get harder 
- is this 2D or 3D? (currently 2D but woudl like to move to 3D eventually)
